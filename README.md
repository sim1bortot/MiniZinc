MiniZinc Projects

A collection of MiniZinc exercises developed during the Automated Reasoning course to gain hands-on experience with constraint modeling and problem solving.

1. nQueens.mnz

Determine whether it is possible to place n queens on an n × n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, following standard chess rules.

2. Latin Square

A Latin square is an n × n grid filled with n distinct symbols such that each symbol appears exactly once in every row and exactly once in every column.

3. Knight Path

Find a sequence of moves that allows a knight to visit every square on a chessboard exactly once.
If a solution exists, print the coordinates of each step in the knight’s path
